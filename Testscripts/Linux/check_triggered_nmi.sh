# Description:
#	This script was created to automate the testing of a Linux
#	Integration services. This script will verify if a NMI sent
#	from Hyper-V is received  inside the Linux VM, by checking the
#	/proc/interrupts file.
#	The test performs the following steps:
#	 1. Make sure we have a constants.sh file.
#	 2. Looks for the NMI property of each CPU.
#	 3. For 2012R2, verifies if each CPU has received a NMI.
#	 4. For 2016, verifies only cpu0 has received a NMI.
